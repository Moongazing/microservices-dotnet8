# Moongazing.Microservices

## Overview

Moongazing.Microservices is a robust suite of microservices designed with a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. Our architecture leverages the latest features of .NET 8, ensuring high performance and scalability. We utilize GraphQL for flexible, client-specified queries and gRPC for efficient inter-service communication.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organized around the business domain to ensure that the complexity is addressed by the design.
- **GraphQL API**: Enables clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more, making it easy to evolve APIs over time.

- **.NET 8**: The latest iteration of the .NET framework, providing advanced features for building high-performance systems.
